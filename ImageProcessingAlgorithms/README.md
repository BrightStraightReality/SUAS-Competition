# Image Processing Algorithms

This folder contains an assortment of different image processing algorithms. I have added them all in case we need to use them during the processing of SUAS images.

The list of algorithms demonstrated:

1. ROF (Rudin-Osher-Fatemi) de-noising model
2. Sobel & Gaussian X and Y derivative identification -- Preprocessing technique
3. Gaussian Blurring -- Preprocessing technique
4. Histogram Equalization -- Preprocessing technique
5. Image Averaging -- Preprocessing technique
6. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) -- Preprocessing technique
